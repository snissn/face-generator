            Shape Faces is a generative block chain based art project. Shape Faces is an artistic study of what happens when we start with the fundamental building blocks of reality - Shapes and build up from those shapes a unique yet recognizable view of humanity.<p>
            </p>
            <p class="subtitle p-2">
              We contrast our art from other projects in a few novel, technical and artistic ways. Firstly we generate and store all of our metadata on the block chain during the minting process. Upon mint the blockchain stores a seed value that fully defines how the Shape Face will look. Second we focus on symmetry and simplicity in our faces in order to build up from the mathematical void a series of shapes that trigger familiarity and humanity in the observers brain. Other projects like crypto punks start with hand drawn face shapes and build complexity on top of that. Our faces are simply Circles and Triangles.
